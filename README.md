# Snake

## V.1.0
This was my first attempt at recreating the classic snake game from scratch. I used the turtles libraray to create the screen that the game is played on as well 
as the components that are used in the snake game such as the food and the scoreboard. From there I made the snake move across the screen and respond to keyboard 
inputs (arrow keys to move) and I implemented detection checks to ensure the game ends if the snake touches the borders or itself.
